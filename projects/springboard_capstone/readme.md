This folder is exclusively for the Capstone project done with the guidance of mentor through [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com)

#### A few words on that:

+ The way that Springboard online bootcamp operates is a bit different. It is "not yet another coding/datascience bootcamp", nor is it same as doing with MOOCs.
+ Doing with guidance means, living upto more challenges. It is no way less than doing on our own. In fact it is much better than that, for reasons explained below:
+ The experience of having worked with a very senior data scientist already is definitely going to take me a long way in the first job. It partially compensate for lack of prior experience in data science industry.
+ Even for choosing the problem to work on for Capstone, mentor just gives guidelines and asks to come up with 3-4 ideas which might make business sense to someone. Thus the student chooses the problem.
+ The mentor is available once a week for half an hour for a quick review of week's work. He is there to correct any errors and ask thought provoking questions, and not to provide answers.
+ He acts like a hypothetical client, (who is never happy!, ah, just kidding. Mine is too nice) hence we work in a simulated data scientists team
+ Learning right the first time definitely is an efficient way to learn and helps to retain the learnings.

##### Quality of people who do mentoring:
+ The mentor is a practicing data scientist with many years of experience, who is upto date with current technology and trends.
+ Springboard interview process for mentors is said to be very tough. They claim to have recruited 1 in 12 applicants.

+ The proof for all of these points is apparent in the work (to be checked in soon).
