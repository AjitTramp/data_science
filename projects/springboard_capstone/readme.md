This folder is exclusively for the Capstone project done with the guidance of mentor through [springboard](https://www.springboard.com)

#### A few words on that:

+ The way that springboard online bootcamp operates is a bit different. It is "not yet another coding/datascience bootcamp", nor is it same as doing with MOOC
+ Doing with guidance means, living upto more challenges. It is no way less than doing on our own. In fact it is much better than that.
+ The Mentor is a practicing data scientist with many years of experience.
+ Springboard interview process for mentors is said to be very tough. They claim they recruit one in 12 applicants.
+ The mentor is available once a week for half an hour for a quick review of week's work. He is there to correct any errors and ask thought provoking questions, and not to provide answers.
+ He acts like a hypothetical client, (who is never happy!, ah, just kidding. Mine is too nice) hence we work as a simulated data scientist role
+ Learning right the first time definitely is an efficient way to learn and helps to retain the learnings.
+ The proof for all of these points is apparent in the work (to be checked in soon).
+ The experience of having worked with a very senior data scientist already is definitely going to take me a long way in the first job. It partially compensate for lack of prior experience in data science industry.
